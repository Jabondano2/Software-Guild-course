Form widgets
A widget is an interactive component (usually graphical) that the browser uses to interact with a user. Ex: Buttons, drop-down menus, and data entry fields.

The input tag allows the user to enter information into a web page. The input tag cannot enclose any additional page content, and thus does not have a closing tag. The input tag has five primary attributes:

The type attribute indicates the widget type. Common types include text, password, submit, and button.
The name attribute names the widget and sends the widget's value when the widget's form is submitted.
The id attribute is used to give a widget a unique identifier.
The placeholder attribute specifies text that first appears in a text widget, typically for giving the user a hint as to the expected value.
The value attribute specifies a default value for a widget.

2.5 Audio and video
Browser plug-ins

Audio element
The audio element plays an audio file in a web page. The element is used inside the audio tag to specify an audio file to play. Some common audio attributes include:
autoplay - Boolean attribute that makes the audio begin playing automatically.
controls - Boolean attribute that displays audio controls for the user to play, pause, and control the volume.
loop - Boolean attribute that replays the audio upon reaching the end of the audio.
muted - Boolean attribute that initially mutes the audio.

Note: Some browsers block audio autoplay from autoplaying so users are not jolted with sound when visiting a web page.
PARTICIPATION ACTIVITY 2.5.2: Audio element.
Video element
The video element displays a video in a web page. The element is used in a video tag to specify the name of the video file to play. Some common video attributes include:
autoplay - Boolean attribute that makes the video begin playing automatically.
controls - Boolean attribute that displays video controls for the user to play, pause, and control the volume.
loop - Boolean attribute that replays the audio upon reaching the end of the video.
muted - Boolean attribute that initially mutes the video.
width - Specifies the pixel width of the video's display area.
PARTICIPATION ACTIVITY 2.5.4: Playing a video.
Showing YouTube videos
A YouTube video may be embedded in a web page with the iframe element.
PARTICIPATION ACTIVITY 2.5.6: Embedding a YouTube video.
The web page below uses the iframe tag to embed a YouTube video in the web page. The URL of the YouTube web page ends with "7g7kP_Trp0g?rel=0". 7g7kP_Trp0g is the ID assigned to the video when the video was first uploaded to YouTube, and ?rel=0 disables showing related videos when the video finishes. Click the video to play the video, and the pause button to pause the video. Add &autoplay=1&mute=1 to the end of the YouTube URL and render the web page. The video should play automatically, but with no sound. Change the video ID in the URL to g4hvUvBmoaA and render the web page. A different video should display in the iframe.

Fallbacks and polyfills
A fallback is a mechanism that allows a web page element to function correctly even if the browser does not support a particular element. Good practice is to implement a fallback mechanism if a particular widget is not widely supported by browsers at the time.

A polyfill is a fallback using JavaScript code that makes certain HTML features (Ex: the date picker) work on browsers that do not natively support those features. Developers often use a JavaScript library such as Modernizr to detect which features the browser does not support, and then load one or more polyfills to provide fallback mechanisms for the non-supported features.

Example 2.4.7: A date polyfill.
Select an appointment date:


dd/mm/yyyy


Select an appointment date:

The White House is the official residence of the President of the United States.

2.7 HTML developer guidelines
Use closing tags

Avoid self-closing tags

Use quotes for attributes values

Use double quotes

Use boolean attributes concisely



Pick an option below

Submit
Use lowercase for all tags and attributes

Start block elements on new lines

Indent nested elements consistently

Provide labels and placeholders

Always provide labels and/or placeholders for widgets. Ex:
Favorite sport: 
Favorite sport
Separate content from presentation and functionality

Good practice is to use separate files for CSS and JavaScript instead of placing CSS and JavaScript in the HTML document. Ex: Instead of using the style tags for specifying CSS rules within the HTML document, specify the CSS rules in a separate CSS file, such as theme.css, and import the file using link rel="stylesheet" href="theme.css"

Use CSS for layout

CSS is designed for layout
Validate HTML

Good practice is to validate HTML using an HTML validator and revise the HTML to eliminate any errors or warnings. Implementing the guidelines The web page below implements the developer guidelines:
Closing tags like /p and /li are always used.
Double quotes are used around all attribute values, and boolean attributes like checked are used appropriately.
All tags and attributes are lowercase, and tags are indented properly.
Block elements like p and ol start on new lines.
The form uses labels for all widgets.
Separate CSS and JavaScript files are imported with link and script tags instead of placing the CSS and JavaScript in the HTML document.
The table tag is used for displaying tabular data and not for laying out the page contents.
Example Website:
According to the USA Today, the three busiest travel days are:

Summer weekends
Thanksgiving
Christmas

3.2 Basic selectors
The element selector matches elements with the specified element names.
Ex: p { color: blue; } selects all p elements.
The class selector, specified with a period character followed by the class name, matches elements that have the specified class name.
Ex: .notice { color: blue; } selects all elements with a class="notice" attribute.
The ID selector, specified with a hash character followed by the ID name, matches the element that has the specified ID.
Ex: #byLine { color: blue; } selects the element with the id="byLine" attribute.
The descendant selector, specified with a selector followed by a space and another selector, matches elements that are contained in other elements.
Ex: h2 em { color: blue; } selects em elements contained in h2 elements.
The pseudo-class selector, specified with a colon character followed by a pseudo-class name, matches elements based on user behavior or element metainformation.
Ex: :hover { color: blue; } selects elements under the mouse cursor.

CSS variables
A CSS variable is a custom CSS property that defines a value. A CSS variable is declared in a CSS selector that defines the variable's scope. A CSS variable can have global scope by declaring the variable in the :root selector, which targets the highest DOM element: the element. A CSS variable is defined with two dashes preceding the variable name. Ex: --my-variable: red; A CSS variable is accessed with the var() function. Ex: var(--my-variable);
Example - see code:
<"style>
:root { --main-color: red;
--main-bg-color: yellow;
}
p {
color: var(--main-color);
background-color: var(--main-bg-color);
}
<"/style>
The sun rises and sets.

3.5 Font and text properties
Font properties
Many CSS properties control the font properties for displaying text. CSS font properties include:
The font-family property specifies the font family, such as "Times New Roman" or serif.
The font-size property changes the font size, such as 120%, small, or 12px.
The font-weight property specifies the font weight, such as normal or bold.
The font-style property changes the text style, such as normal, italic, or oblique.
The font-variant property specifies the variant of the text, such as normal or small-caps.
The font property is shorthand for setting several font properties at the same time. Ex: font: italic 12pt Georgia, serif;
<"style> p { font-family: "Verdana", "Arial", sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; } #band { font-style: italic; font-size: 120%; } #music { font-variant: small-caps; } <"/style>
My favorite band is The Shins, because their music is thought-provoking!

Text properties
Many CSS properties control how text is displayed. Some common CSS text properties include:

The text-align property changes the horizontal alignment of text for an element. Possible values are: left, right, center, and justify.
The text-decoration property can add or remove text decorations like underlining or a line-through. Possible values are: overline, line-through, underline, and none.
The text-transform property converts letters to UPPERCASE, lowercase, or Capitalizes Initial Letters. Possible values are: uppercase, lowercase, and capitalize.
The text-indent property specifies the first line's indentation amount.
The CSS text-decoration:none is commonly used to remove the default underline from links.

3.6 Box model
Box model components
HTML elements take up space on the web page. The box model describes the size of each element as a series of nested boxes. The box model is important to understand when considering design and layout.

Content: The innermost box contains the content of the element, such as text and images.
Padding: The padding box contains the content box and adds a transparent area around the content.
Border: The border box contains the padded content and adds an optionally colored area around the padding.
Margin: The margin box contains all three boxes and adds a transparent area around the border.
< 
The CSS properties that control the padding, border, and margin are:

The padding property specifies the padding thickness. Ex: padding: 5px; creates a 5 pixel padding around the content.
The border property specifies the border's thickness, style, and color. Ex: border: 2px solid blue; creates a solid blue border that is 2 pixels thick.
The margin property specifies the margin thickness. Ex: margin: 10px; creates a 10 pixel margin.

Border styles
The border property combines the border width, style, and color. Each CSS property may also be specified separately:

The border-width property specifies the border's width. Ex: border-width: 5px; specifies a border that is 5px thick.
The border-style property specifies the border's style. Ex: border-style: dashed; specifies a border that is dashed.
The border-color property specifies the border's color. Ex: border-color: green; specifies a border that is green.

4.1 Flexbox
Fluid layout
CSS is instrumental in creating a page layout that is visually appealing. Many websites use the same layout on every web page for consistency. The layout normally contains the following sections:

Header at the top that identifies the website
Navigational links at the top or left side that present the main links for navigating the website
Various sections that include related content
Footer at the bottom that contains contact information, copyright, author name, etc.

4.2 Grid layout
Grid container and grid items
Grid layout is a CSS layout mode that divides a web page into a rectangular grid in which to position page elements. Grid layout is ideal for designing two-dimensional web page layouts.

A grid container is an element that has the CSS property display set to grid to create a block-level grid container or grid-inline to create an inline grid container. Ex: <"div style="display: grid">. A grid item is a child element of a grid container that is by default placed into a single grid cell.

The grid-template-columns property defines the grid container's number of columns and optionally the width of each column. Ex: grid-template-columns: 50px 90px auto auto; specifies 4 values that create 4 columns: the first is 50px wide, the second is 90px wide, and the third and fourth columns are automatically sized to fit the remainder of the grid width.

Controlling the grid container
The default behavior of a grid container can be modified with various CSS properties:
The grid-gap property defines the gap between each grid column and row. Ex: grid-gap: 10px 20px; puts a 10px gap between each row 20px gap between each column.
The grid-template-rows property defines the height of each row. Ex: grid-template-rows: 20px 40px; makes the first row 20px tall and the second row 40px tall.
The justify-content property horizontally aligns the grid items inside the grid container using values: start - Aligns grid flush with the grid container's starting edge. end - Aligns grid flush with the grid container's ending edge. center - Aligns grid in the center of the grid container. stretch - Stretches the grid items to fill the grid container width. space-around - Places equal spacing between grid items with half the space on either side of the grid container. space-between - Places equal spacing between grid items with no space on either side of the grid container. space-evenly - Places equal spacing between grid items, including the sides of the grid container.
The align-content property vertically aligns the grid items inside the grid container using values:
start - Aligns grid flush with the grid container's starting edge. end - Aligns grid flush with the grid container's ending edge. center - Aligns grid in the center of the grid container. stretch - Stretches the grid items to fill the grid container height. space-around - Places equal spacing between grid items with half the space on either side of the grid container. space-between - Places equal spacing between grid items with no space on either side of the grid container. space-evenly - Places equal spacing between grid items, including the sides of the grid container.
The justify-content and align-content properties have no effect unless the grid width or height is less than the grid container's width or height.

5. Mobile Web Development
6. Basic JavaScript
7. JavaScript in the Browser
7.1 Using JavaScript with HTML
Basics
Web pages add JavaScript code by using the script tag. JavaScript code between script /script tags is executed by the browser's JavaScript engine.

Example: 7.1.1: Writing JavaScript within the body of an HTML file.
Magic 8 Ball

Magic 8 Ball says... Don't count on it.

Window object
window.location is a location object that contains information about the window's current URL. Ex: window.location.hostname is the URL's hostname.

window.navigator is a navigator object that contains information about the browser. Ex: window.navigator.userAgent returns the browser's user agent string.

window.innerHeight and window.innerWidth are the height and width in pixels of the window's content area. Ex: window.innerWidth returns 600 if the browser's content area is 600 pixels wide.

The window object defines some useful methods:
window.alert() displays an alert dialog box. Ex: window.alert("Hello") displays a dialog box with the message "Hello".

window.confirm() displays a confirmation dialog box with OK and Cancel buttons. confirm() returns true if OK is pressed and false if Cancel is pressed. Ex: window.confirm("Are you sure?") displays a dialog box with the question.

window.open() opens a new browser window. Ex: window.open("http://www.twitter.com/") opens a new browser that loads the Twitter web page.

Using the console
Good practice is to leave the console open while writing and testing JavaScript code.

API (Application Programming Interface)
The console API includes the following methods:

console.log() displays informational data to the console. console.warn() displays warnings to the console. The browser usually has a special indicator to differentiate a warning from the standard log message. Ex: A yellow warning box. console.error() displays errors to the console. The browser usually has a special indicator to differentiate an error from a warning or the standard log message. Ex: A red error box. console.dir() displays a JavaScript object to the console. The browser usually supports a method for compactly representing the object. Ex: a hierarchical tree representation allowing a developer to expand and collapse the object contents.
Loading JavaScript from an external file
Good practice is to use script tags to load JavaScript from external files rather than writing the JavaScript directly within the HTML file. The script tag's src attribute specifies a JavaScript file to load.

Minification and obfuscation
To reduce the amount of JavaScript that must be downloaded from a web server, developers often minify a website's JavaScript. Minification or minimization is the process of removing unnecessary characters (like whitespace and comments)

A JavaScript obfuscator is software that converts JavaScript into an unreadable form that is very difficult to convert back into readable JavaScript. Developers obfuscate a website's JavaScript to prevent the code from being read or re-purposed by others. Obfuscated code may also be minified and appear in a ".min.js" file.
